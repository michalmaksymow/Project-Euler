# Project Euler Solutions

Welcome to my collection of code for solving Project Euler problems. I solve these mathematical and computational conundrums for self-development purposes, mainly to gain expertise in algorithms and data structures, practice problem-solving skills, and ultimately to become a better programmer.

Every problem in this list is solved in one of the following programming languages: C++, Python, or another language that best serves the problem at hand. The choice of programming language may vary based on the characteristics of the problem and the most suitable algorithms and data structures for the task.

### Contents

The repository is divided into multiple directories, each representing a different programming language used for the solutions. Inside each directory, you will find a number of files, each corresponding to a specific Project Euler problem. The name of the file typically signifies the problem number.

### Usage

The code in this repository can be executed using the appropriate compiler or interpreter for the corresponding programming language. In some cases, you may need additional libraries or modules, which will be specified in the comments at the start of the file.

### Explanations

Wherever necessary or relevant, some problems contain detailed mathematical explanations or proofs in the comments, shedding light on the underlying theory and justifications for certain steps or decisions. This additional information helps provide a deeper understanding of the problem and its solution.

### Feedback and Collaboration

I am open to constructive feedback and collaboration. If you have any suggestions for improving the solutions or have different approaches to the problems, feel free to raise an issue on the repository or make a pull request.

Please note that this is a personal project and is by no means intended to provide ready-made solutions for Project Euler problems. The goal here is to encourage learning, exploration, and the joy of problem-solving. I strongly advise against using these solutions to bypass the genuine intellectual effort required to solve these problems.
