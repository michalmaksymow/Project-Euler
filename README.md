Project Euler Solutions
=======================

My collection of code for solving Project Euler problems. I solve Project Euler problems for self-development purposes, mainly to gain expertise in algorithms and data structures, practice problem solving and become a better programmer.

Every problem in this list is solved in either C++ or Python. Some problems have detailed mathematical explanations or proofs in the comments.

I have also added a simple timer class which uses `std::chrono` in order to measure C++ function durations.
